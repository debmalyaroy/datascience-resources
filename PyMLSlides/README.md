## Machine learning slides

I created these slides for my machine learning course that I teach at [Loyola University Chicago](http://www.luc.edu/cs/). These slides are *mostly* based on Sebastian Raschka's [Python Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka/dp/1783555130/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1496671816&sr=8-1&keywords=python+machine+learning) book. Please see Sebastian's github [repository](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book) for additional course materials such as the full set of equations used in the text and the code samples.

**NOTE:** Be sure to download the [Code directory](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book/tree/master/code) into the same place where you cloned this repository. Some slides will not compile without it!

## Acknowledgements

I am grateful to Sebastian for providing the latex source for the equations used in the book.
