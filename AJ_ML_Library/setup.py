## This file will be used to define some system specific parameters used in the module

# Set the location of the directory in which the module is located. For example in my case it is:
# module_location = '/Users/aarshay/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/AJ_ML_Library'

#Update for your case:
module_location = '/Users/aarshay/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/AJ_ML_Library'
